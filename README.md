# Data Assimilation for Geophysical Processes

Part of the work done for the undergraduate project I in the semester 2024-25-I at IIT Kanpur. The notebook outlines a data assimilation techniques for modeling geophysical processes such as soil moisture, temperature, or precipitation. The notebook integrates observational data with simulated data to improve environmental predictions using data assimilation frameworks.

## Features

- Implementation of data assimilation using ensemble/statistical techniques
- Visualization of prior, observed, and assimilated states
- Integration of satellite-derived or synthetic observation data
- Support for time series analysis and spatial visualization
